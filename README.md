# Pattern Level Editor

Here is a very simple [Pattern][pattern] level editor.

## Usage

Open [`pattern-level-editor.html`][editor] in your browser, select a size, press
“New”, and then start editing your level. Click on a cell to fill it, and click
again to unfill it. When you’re done, click on “Export”, and copy the selected
string.  This is your level ID. In Pattern, go in the “Game” menu, click on
“Specific…”, then enter your level ID, and enjoy!
